Loan Payback Prediction Model
Project Overview
This project is designed to predict the likelihood of loan payback using several machine learning algorithms. The model is built using a detailed and structured process to ensure accurate predictions. By utilizing various classification algorithms, this project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to tackling loan default predictions.

Project Steps
The steps involved in building this Loan Payback Prediction Model are outlined below:

Load Data

The dataset containing information about loan applicants is loaded. This data includes features like income, loan amount, credit score, and more.
Data Visualization and Pre-processing

Initial exploration of the data is done to understand the distribution and relationships between variables. Visualizations are used to spot trends, patterns, and potential outliers.
Feature Selection/Extraction

Relevant features are selected based on their importance in predicting loan payback. Feature extraction may also be performed to create new variables that enhance model performance.
Convert Categorical Features to Numerical Values

Many machine learning algorithms require numerical inputs. Categorical features such as loan types, employment status, or education levels are converted to numerical representations.
One-Hot Encoding

To handle categorical variables efficiently, one-hot encoding is applied. This process creates binary columns (0s and 1s) for each category, ensuring the model can interpret the data correctly.
Normalize Data

To improve model performance and convergence, data normalization is performed. This ensures that all features have a similar scale, which helps in distance-based algorithms like K Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
Main Classification Algorithms

Multiple classification algorithms are employed to compare their performance in predicting loan payback:
K Nearest Neighbor (KNN): A distance-based classifier that predicts the likelihood of loan payback based on the 'k' closest data points.
Decision Tree: A tree-based model that splits the data into branches to predict whether a loan will be paid back.
Support Vector Machine (SVM): A powerful classifier that uses hyperplanes to separate loan payback vs. default predictions.
Logistic Regression: A regression model that outputs the probability of loan payback based on the input features.
Installation

Model Evaluation
Each classification algorithm is evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to determine the best-performing model for predicting loan payback.
